Thrilled to share my first-ever Tableau Dashboard! ðŸŽ‰ As a beginner, I've been diving into data visualization and finally built this "American Sales Dashboard."

Key insights I'm excited about:

The sales peak in November and December (always a busy time!).

Binders and Phones clearly dominating product sales.

This project was a great way to learn about connecting data, calculated fields, and dashboard design. The journey is just beginning!
